# Install
Copy "Long War" and other folders to HotA_RMGTemplates directory of your HotA installation.

# Longwar
The template pack for HotA random map generator optimized for giant maps.

# Death from Below
The template for 3 humans and 5 strong AI opponents. Recommended generator settings: "Giant" map, "Normal" water, "Strong" monsters. If you want a harder challenge, set AI teams.

## Goals
* Challenging
* Not boring
* Playable without save scumming

# Enlightment Circle
This is the updated version of the previous template. Added more AI and human cities, added Town Portals. Recommended generator settings: "Giant" map, "No" water, "Strong" monsters.

# Please Spare my Implings
Swapped underground and surface planes to ensure DD connectivity of the second plane.

# Artificers
Added water back.
No mines to delay player expansion. Still computer is not able to collect troops successfully, compliant zones should have low value guards.
Hero spawners work this time. Still all the heroes go to the underworld map, this was not expected.


# Plans
Thinking how to implement a slower yet interesting start. Planning to ship new releases for each HotA editor release.

# Testing
Subterranean gate. Underworld connectivity. Map validation. Interesting hero availability. Well. GoSolo.
