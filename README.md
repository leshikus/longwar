# Install
Copy "Long War" and other folders to HotA_RMGTemplates directory of your HotA installation.

# Longwar
The template pack for HotA random map generator optimized for giant maps.

# Death from Below
The template for 3 humans and 5 strong AI opponents. Recommended generator settings: "Giant" map, "Normal" water, "Strong" monsters. If you want a harder challenge, set AI teams.

## Goals
* Challenging
* Not boring
* Playable without save scumming

# Enlightment Circle
This is the updated version of the previous template. Added more AI and human cities, added Town Portals. Recommended generator settings: "Giant" map, "No" water, "Strong" monsters.

# Please Spare my Implings
Swapped underground and surface planes to ensure DD connectivity of the second plane.

# Artificers
* Added water back.
* No mines to delay player expansion.
* Computer hero spawners generate 8 heroes at the game start.

## Problems
* Computer is not able to collect troops successfully, compliant zones should have low value guards, should be smaller.
* Player necromancer town should have several vampire dwellings.
* Spawned heroes move to the underworld map, this was not expected and makes things easier.
* Add increased exit guard difficulty and size for compliant zones, thus making each next enemy stronger.
* Computer cannot play well for human starts.
* Too easy to get the first ship, think of putting hard terrain around starting areas.

# Plans
Thinking how to implement a slower yet interesting start. Planning to ship new releases for each HotA editor release.

# Testing
Subterranean gate. Underworld connectivity. Map validation. Interesting hero availability. Well. GoSolo.
